# Data Structures Documentation

## Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, called a node. Each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.

## Binary Tree
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Graph
A graph is a collection of nodes, called vertices, and edges that connect pairs of vertices.
