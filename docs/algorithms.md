## Quicksort
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

### Steps:
1. Choose a pivot element.
2. Partition the array into sub-arrays.
3. Recursively sort the sub-arrays.

### Example:
